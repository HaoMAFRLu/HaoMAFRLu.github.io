Description: I served twice (06.2024 block course and 02.2023 – 06.2023) as a teaching assistant for Dr. Michael Muehlebach at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich for the course ``Large-Scale Convex Optimization''. I was mainly responsible for the colloquia and designing exercises and exams.

Abstract
======
Convex optimization has revolutionized modern decision making and underpins many scientific and engineering disciplines. To enable its use in modern large-scale applications, we require new analytical methods that address limitations of existing solutions. This course is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of convex analysis and numerical methods for large-scale optimization.

Learning Objective
======
Students should be able to apply the fundamental results in convex analysis and numerical methods to analyze and solve large-scale convex optimization problems.

Content
======
Convex analysis and methods for large-scale optimization. Topics will include: convex sets and functions ; duality theory ; optimality and infeasibility conditions ; structured optimization problems ; gradient-based methods ; operator splitting methods ; distributed and decentralized optimization ; applications in various research areas.
